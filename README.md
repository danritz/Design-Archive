# Design Archive

A permanent place for links to books, videos, and podcasts I find particularly helpful. I expect to read, watch, and listen to everything here several times. Hopefully, this will keep the quality high and resist trends.

Before you dig in, remember to always remind yourself:

### [THE GAP](https://vimeo.com/85040589) — Ira Glass

Do more work. Do better work. Keep fighting. Everyone struggles.

### [An Invocation for Beginnings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g) — Ze Frank

Starting is always hard. Get started anyway. Worry about being done later.
