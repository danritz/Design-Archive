### [Badass: Making Users Awesome](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1491919019/) — Kathy Sierra

Kathy is one of my heroes. She does an amazing job reframing how a product shouldn’t be cool, but help make the person using it cool. It’s a subtle shift in thinking, but makes a big difference in how things are designed. She magically balances being aggressive and driven, while still having a humble, empathetic viewpoint.

### [Notes on the Synthesis of Form](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0674627512) — Christopher Alexander

Such a good book on the “other stuff” around a design that constrains and defines it. This is usually what makes the difference in a good and great designer. It’s easy to atomize the thing you’re designing at the expense of the larger system, often making things worse. A great designer knows when the context of a design can be exploited to make a typically less effective tactic more valuable.
