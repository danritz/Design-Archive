## Thinking about users

### [Badass: Making Users Awesome](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1491919019/) — Kathy Sierra

Kathy does an amazing job reframing how a product shouldn’t be cool, but help make the person using it cool. It’s a subtle shift in thinking, but makes a big difference in how things are designed. She magically balances being aggressive and driven, while still having a humble, empathetic point of view.

### [Designing for People](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581153120/) — Henry Dreyfuss

The earliest book (1955) I’m aware of dedicated completely to studying people to design better objects, tools, and places. I think a lot of the time people think about the product first and then how it can fit into people’s lives. This book is hard-core about putting people first. Also, he’s a legendary industrial designer. So not a bad person to study or emulate.

### [Don’t Make Me Think](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/) — Steve Krug

There’s a lot of great books about usability, but this one does the best job of framing the struggle specifically around the user. The goal is to make them think about making progress on their problems, not about using your software. It sounds obvious, but most usability thinking is framed through the software. Making the software less bad will never get you to great (probably not even good). Making the user think less will.

## Thinking about systems

### [Notes on the Synthesis of Form](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0674627512) — Christopher Alexander

Such a good book on the “other stuff” around a design that constrains and defines it. This is usually what makes the difference in a good and great designer. It’s easy to atomize the thing you’re designing at the expense of the larger system, often making things worse. A great designer knows when the context of a design can be exploited to make a typically less effective tactic more valuable.

### [The Innovator’s Dilemma](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062060244/) — Clayton M. Christensen

One of my favorite descriptions for why things typically fail over the long term. A much more concrete way to think about competition, the market, and the overall context of your product. This was the first book that really made me stop and think about prioritizing being adaptive with existing software over building new software.

### [Setting the Table](http://www.amazon.com/Setting-Table-Danny-Meyer-ebook/dp/B000OI0FCQ/) — Danny Meyer

It’s a book about restaurants and hospitality. It’s about designing a physical place to give someone a good experience. Software is less tangible, but we’re trying to do the same thing. What’s surprising about this book is that most of the Danny’s success seems to come from how he treats people in his restaurants, not the food. The food has to great, but you’ll never have a long lasting and successful restaurant until you learn how to treat people like people. I believe it’s the same with software.

### [Metaphors We Live By](http://www.amazon.com/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468011) — George Lakoff

Probably the hardest book to read on this list. I can only read a few chapters at a time. It’s heavy. It’s worth it, though. Metaphors are so powerful in explaining how we understand and deal with the world around us. Getting a better sense for how people relate to the world opens up a lot of possibilities for designing better interfaces.

### [Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0262611465) — Gary Klein

This isn’t a design book. I’m not even sure I would call it a psychology book. It’s the most thorough and detailed book on how people make decision I’ve ever read.

### [Managing Humans](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/159059844X) — Micheal Lopp

Software people are strange. Working with them can be a challenge wether you’re managing them or not. This is one of the best books I’ve read on working with software people. It’s a little more specific to engineers, but as a designer it still felt right.

## Thinking about the role

### [Thoughts on Interaction Design](http://www.amazon.com/Thoughts-Interaction-Design-Second-Kolko/dp/0123809304/) — Jon Kolko

Jon can get a little philosophical, but makes up for it with all the tattoos and body piercings. This is his best book with small, helpful stories about how people interact with things. He does a great job showing what specializing in “interaction design” means.

### [Sketching User Experiences](http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371) — Bill Buxton

Jam packed with real examples for many theoretical and abstract design ideas. Even if you’re familiar with a lot of the techniques, having some concrete stories about them makes a world of difference. Lots of little chapters so it’s easy to put down and reflect.

### [101 Things I Learned in Architecture School](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262062666/) — Matthew Frederick

A bunch of small, simple lessons that apply very well to design. This covers what you would learn in design school.

### [Thinking with Type](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568989695/) — Ellen Lupton

Design is 95% typography. All the colors and boxes and gradients and shadows are all meant to get the right words noticed the right way at the right time. The more thought you put into the design of the “content” itself, the less gratuitous visual design you’ll need.

### [On Writing Well](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B0090RVGW0/) — William Zinsser

Writing for interfaces is hard. Often you only have a word or a short phrase to put in a button or headline. This is my favorite writing book specifically for his focus on brevity and clarity, even at the expense of grammar. If you like your grammar rules, this guy might piss you off.

### [How to Think Like a Great Graphic Designer](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Great-Graphic-Designer/dp/1581154968/) — Debbie Millman

A great collection of amazing design thinkers giving fun, short, and valuable stories about how they approach everyday problems. I typically don't get much from short histories of designers — there's rarely anything immediately useful. This one is different.

### [Do the Work](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1936719010) — Steven Pressfield

Short and sweet. To be good at something you have to do the work — be prolific. There’s no shortcut. Somehow Steven makes this sound like a good thing. He also makes it fun.
