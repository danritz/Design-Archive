### [Designing and building software products for humans](https://www.breaker.audio/laroche-dot-fm-podcast/e/30739854) â€” Ryan Singer, Basecamp

I love how he frames design as a big, far-reaching concern that touches every part of the business. It's a deep and interesting problem. Stressing knowledge of real life in current settings with specific situational concerns is how you untangle design work. Draws a hard line that you can't plan a significant project in advance. Nice touch at the end about how small changes should help clarify the whole, not fragment the application into a set of smaller, independent concerns.
