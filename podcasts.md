### [Designing and building software products for humans](https://www.breaker.audio/laroche-dot-fm-podcast/e/30739854) — Ryan Singer, Basecamp

I love how he frames design as a big, far-reaching concern that touches every part of the business. It's a deep and interesting problem. Stressing knowledge of real life in current settings with specific situational concerns is how you untangle design work. Draws a hard line that you can't plan a significant project in advance. Nice touch at the end about how small changes should help clarify the whole, not fragment the application into a set of smaller, independent concerns.

### [Intercom on Product Management](https://www.breaker.audio/intercom-on-product-management) — Intercom (9 episodes)

Each episode is short and sweet. Most are five to ten minutes on a very specific topic. I love that the first episode is about understanding what people are doing in the present — the most underrated information of a product development team. Even though these episodes are catering to product *management*, they either heavily overlap with design work or are critacal for designers to understand.
