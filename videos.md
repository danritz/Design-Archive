## Thinking about users

My scattered list of videos seems to have similar theme to books. Adding here soon.

## Thinking about systems

My scattered list of videos seems to have similar theme to books. Many on the way.

### [Making Sense of Complexity] (https://youtu.be/y6RfqmTZejU) — Dave Snowden

Excellent thinking around using certain methods under certain conditions. Getting a sense of the level of complexity of the work you're doing. What tools and tactics fit with the work your doing. Probably the closest explanation I've found for being "strategic" with software design and development. Knowing when to switch your style of work to exploit current conditions.

### [Re-thinking IT](https://vimeo.com/19122939) — John Seddon

A thorough explanation with tangible examples of managing value instead of cost. When you try to reduce cost, you tend to reduce the ability to absorb variation, which unintentionally increases cost. When you try to increase value, you tend to increase variety of use while still consolidating common work in a way that drives cost out of the system. This is probably one of the more counterintuitive areas of design and building systems.

*Warning: he makes a sexist comment about how women spend money — I'm looking for an alternative video for this topic.*
