## Thinking about users

### [Building the Minimum Bad Ass User](https://vimeo.com/81625882) — Kathy Sierra

Kathy does an amazing job reframing how a product shouldn’t be cool, but help make the person using it cool. It’s a subtle shift in thinking, but makes a big difference in how things are designed. She magically balances being aggressive and driven, while still having a humble, empathetic point of view.

## Thinking about systems

### [Making Sense of Complexity](https://youtu.be/y6RfqmTZejU) — Dave Snowden

Excellent thinking around using certain methods under certain conditions. Getting a sense of the level of complexity of the work you're doing. What tools and tactics fit with the work your doing. Probably the closest explanation I've found for being "strategic" with software design and development. Knowing when to switch your style of work to exploit current conditions.

### [Ranch Stories](https://vimeo.com/178863080) — Alan Cooper

Good example of systems when they’re sustainable, instead of extractive and eventually unsustainable. The metaphor of farming and his ranch to design and products was surprisingly powerful.

### [Power of Simplicity](https://youtu.be/NdSD07U5uBs) — Alan Kay

How we often get in our own way and prevent ourselves from making progress. A great use of the debt metaphor and how we tend to double-down on poor theories until things break. Although, the debt metaphor still falls short. It's not just something slowing us down. It's also preventing us from seeing new opportunities.

### [Re-thinking IT](https://vimeo.com/19122939) — John Seddon

A thorough explanation with tangible examples of managing value instead of cost. When you try to reduce cost, you tend to reduce the ability to absorb variation, which unintentionally increases cost. When you try to increase value, you tend to increase variety of use while still consolidating common work in a way that drives cost out of the system. This is probably one of the more counterintuitive areas of design and building systems.

## Thinking about the role

### [Putting Play First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u6HTG8LuXQ) — Nintendo

Prioritizing a core theme to make things easier to learn while staying available to large amounts of variation. An excellent metaphor for being specific about intent while agnostic towards the implementation. Also very smart thinking on absorbing variation in our designs.

### [Sketching the space for a design problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7KBca1eyPo) — Ryan Singer

Visualizing user research across more than two dimensions. This "fingerprint" feels like an information-dense version persona without the story component (for better or worse). It's also a good way to view many fingerprints within the same visualization to understand similar behaviors across users.

### [Q&A: Understanding the Game We're Playing](https://creativemornings.com/talks/simon-sinek-251/) — Simon Sinek

Across a few questions and answers, in aggregate, a fantastic conversation of leadership shows up. Particularly relevant to designers because it's important to understand we're making decisions on behalf of other people. These people want to be understood and trust the designers who are acting on their behalf.
