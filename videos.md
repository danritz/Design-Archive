## Thinking about users

### [Building the Minimum Bad Ass User](https://vimeo.com/81625882) — Kathy Sierra

Kathy does an amazing job reframing how a product shouldn’t be cool, but help make the person using it cool. It’s a subtle shift in thinking, but makes a big difference in how things are designed. She magically balances being aggressive and driven, while still having a humble, empathetic point of view.

### [Facilitating Learning and Wellness in Schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VBywz1c4cs) — Professor Richard Ryan

A great explanation of what kinds of motivation work, temporarily work with unintended consequences, and don't work at all. This is so much better than any of the habit hacking and carrot/stick approaches for enabling people to do good work. A good "brand" happens when your company or your product is seen as a helpful peer, not a bossy supervisor.

*Side-note: this is also great for managers and teams to develop better working relationships.*

## Thinking about systems

### [Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](https://vimeo.com/67076984) — Bret Victor

Building tools that allow us to see, hear, and even think things we normally couldn't. Much of it is noticing the invisible systems around us and using them to our benefit. Developing means to manipulate them.

### [1971 Internal Medicine Grand Rounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMsPXSMTpFI) — Larry Weed

The best presentation I've seen on management in a complex system. It's through the lens of a medical professional interacting with a medical record to understand what should be done for a patient. It's shockingly similar to how a product person should be thinking about their product.

### [Making Sense of Complexity](https://youtu.be/y6RfqmTZejU) — Dave Snowden

Excellent thinking around using certain methods under certain conditions. Getting a sense of the level of complexity of the work you're doing. What tools and tactics fit with the work your doing. Probably the closest explanation I've found for being "strategic" with software design and development. Knowing when to switch your style of work to exploit current conditions.

### [Ranch Stories](https://vimeo.com/178863080) — Alan Cooper

Good example of systems when they’re sustainable, instead of extractive and eventually unsustainable. The metaphor of farming and his ranch to design and products was surprisingly powerful.

### [Power of Simplicity](https://youtu.be/NdSD07U5uBs) — Alan Kay

How we often get in our own way and prevent ourselves from making progress. A great use of the debt metaphor and how we tend to double-down on poor theories until things break. Although, the debt metaphor still falls short. It's not just something slowing us down. It's also preventing us from seeing new opportunities.

### [Re-thinking IT](https://vimeo.com/19122939) — John Seddon

A thorough explanation with tangible examples of managing value instead of cost. When you try to reduce cost, you tend to reduce the ability to absorb variation, which unintentionally increases cost. When you try to increase value, you tend to increase variety of use while still consolidating common work in a way that drives cost out of the system. This is probably one of the more counterintuitive areas of design and building systems.

*Warning: he makes a sexist comment about how women spend money — I'm looking for an alternative video for this topic.*

### [Joshua Arnold interviewed by John Cutler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1xaCFss6q8) — Joshua Arnold

A great exploration of the ways a business determines value and ways it invests its resources. Examples included throughout. Understanding conditions and consequences that influence the system from several different perspectives. A great value structure (four buckets) that's relatively easy to talk about with business minded people about how they view and understand the system they're in. Some top-down and bottom-up pairing that makes sense.

### [Deming 101: Curiosity, Learning, Knowledge, and Improvement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY3ZfCurdjs) — Tim Higgins

Relating pride and joy in work to improving quality. All of this, as a side-effect, pushes inefficiency out of a system. It creates value for the company. Deming was masterful at connecting curiosity to learning, knowledge, and improvement. We need to think of our work environments this way. What comes before understanding? Curiosity and learning. What comes after understanding? Improvement. These are all wrapped up together.

## Thinking about the role

### [Designing from start to finish](https://vimeo.com/16814487) — Ryan Singer

A great alternative to the common pattern of low to high fidelity designs as a way to frame future software development. Instead we should concentrate on getting to real usage in real software, then worry about fleshing out the details.

### [Putting Play First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u6HTG8LuXQ) — Nintendo

Prioritizing a core theme to make things easier to learn while staying available to large amounts of variation. An excellent metaphor for being specific about intent while agnostic towards the implementation. Also very smart thinking on absorbing variation in our designs.

### [Sketching the space for a design problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7KBca1eyPo) — Ryan Singer

Visualizing user research across more than two dimensions. This "fingerprint" feels like an information-dense version persona without the story component (for better or worse). It's also a good way to view many fingerprints within the same visualization to understand similar behaviors across users.

### [Q&A: Understanding the Game We're Playing](https://creativemornings.com/talks/simon-sinek-251/) — Simon Sinek

Across a few questions and answers, in aggregate, a fantastic conversation of leadership shows up. Particularly relevant to designers because it's important to understand we're making decisions on behalf of other people. These people want to be understood and trust the designers who are acting on their behalf.
